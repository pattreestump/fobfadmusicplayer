# fobfadmusicplayer
It's a custom skin for SCM Music Player.
If you use and are asked where you got the skin, please either direct them to my twitter, @notimportant588, or my tumblr, novocainehowell.tumblr.com

Please note: I do not own the logos used on the skin. The "play button" is from the cover of Fall Out Boy's album, Folie a Deux and the right hand symbol is the logo of the band.
